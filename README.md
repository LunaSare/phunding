# phunding

The goal of phunding package is to determine how much money is being used to study different organisms in a Systematics and Phylogenetics context. It allows extracting taxa fron grants awarded by different Institutions (only NSF for now) and mapping these taxa to a (family level) tree of Life.

## Example

This will show a family level tree of life showing taxa that have recieved funding in Systematics and Phylogenetics studies from NSF:
